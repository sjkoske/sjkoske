# My Thoughts on Nutrition

Overall, my thoughts on nutrition fall in line with the "Carnivore" or "Primal" Diets. I would say my general theory is to combine the *most* nutrient dense 
animal foods (preferably raw), with the *least* toxic plant foods. The importance of sunlight also cannot be understated for both your physical and mental health
(which are connected). 

Here are some of my influences on nutritional thought:
