# What I've Been Reading Lately

## Nietzsche

I would say this is my favorite writer/philosopher of all time. Reading Nietzsche to me feels like a crisp sea gale blowing in my face. 
Growing up extremely christian, Nietzsche was someone I had heard of, but never understood. I knew that he was "bad" because he was the one who famously 
said "God is dead", but I had never known any of his ideas or heard anyone try to refute him. I came to realize Christianity generally represented death and a negation of 
life to me , while I felt Nietzsche offered life and vitality. Perhaps we think the same way because we are both Polish/German. 

## Schopenhauer

Schopenhauer is a bit harder to understand for me. I find him extremely humorous though, especially his essays on women and physiognomy.
